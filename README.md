# Algorithm Portfolio
Algorithms portfolio to be used in our projects.

# Motivation for repository creation:
- Have a portfolio of recognized algorithms and provide a friendly API to be
  used in our software development projects.
- The idea is that it can also be used for educational purposes because
  implemented algorithms will have the following information:
  + Typical applications.
  + Textual description of the algorithms.
  + Data structures used by the algorithms.
  + Proposals proposed for the implementation of the algorithms.
  + Correctness profs.
  + Execution times (best case, average case, worst case).
- Another interesting idea is to provide an API so that different
  algorithms with similar purposes can be compared by the user and
  having that information could help to choose one algorithm over another.

# Implemented Algorithms:

- Graph search algorithms:
  + Depth-first search (DFS, dfs)
  + Breadth-first search (BFS, bfs)
  + Dijkstra (Shortest Path)
  + Kruskal's
